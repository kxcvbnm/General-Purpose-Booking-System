# ðŸ“˜ General-Purpose Booking System

# ðŸš§ This project is under active development.

> A Spring Boot + PostgreSQL based booking system that can be adapted to different use cases such as music rooms, table tennis courts, or study rooms. Showcase clean backend architecture, DTO usage, include JWT and best practices for real-world systems.

# ðŸš€ Features

## Auth Management

- Register
- Login
- Access and Refresh tokens

## User Management

- Create, fetch, and delete users
- Roles: USER, ADMIN
- Passwords safely hidden from API responses

## Room Management

- Create and fetch rooms
- Designed to be extendable (different room types, availability slots)

## Booking Management

- Create a booking
- Cancel a booking
- Fetch all bookings or by ID
- User get their own bookings detail
- Bookings keep status (CANCELLED) instead of being deleted

## DTO + Mapper Architecture

- Entities never exposed directly
- Request DTOs
- Response DTOs
- Mappers handle conversion between entities and DTOs

- Backend Framework: Spring Boot 3.5.5 (Java 21)
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Spring Data JPA)
- Build Tool: Maven
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
