## ðŸ“˜ General-Purpose Booking System

## ðŸš§ This project is under active development.

> A Spring Boot + PostgreSQL based booking system that can be adapted to different use cases such as music rooms, table tennis courts, or study rooms. Showcase clean backend architecture, DTO usage, and best practices for real-world systems.

## ðŸš€ Features (current progress)
# User Management
  - Create, fetch, and delete users
  - Roles: USER, ADMIN
  - Passwords safely hidden from API responses

# Room Management
  - Create and fetch rooms
  - Designed to be extendable (different room types, availability slots)

# Booking Management
  - Create a booking (POST /api/bookings)
  - Cancel a booking (PUT /api/bookings/{id}/cancel)
  - Fetch all bookings or by ID
  - Bookings keep status (PENDING, CANCELLED) instead of being deleted

# DTO + Mapper Architecture
  - Entities never exposed directly
  - Request DTOs (BookingRequest)
  - Response DTOs (BookingDTO, UserDTO, RoomDTO)
  - Mappers handle conversion between entities and DTOs

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
  - Backend Framework: Spring Boot (Java 21)
  - Database: PostgreSQL (via Spring Data JPA)
  - Build Tool: Maven
  - Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
  - API Testing: Postman
