# ðŸ“˜ General-Purpose Booking System

> ## Why this project exists
>
> I started this project to solve a very real problem I face as students. My universityâ€™s music rooms open for booking at 08:00â€”onsite only. If youâ€™re not physically there right on time, all slots are gone. That means early commutes, long lines, and lots of frustration just to secure a practice session.

> ## What I'm building
>
> A reliable, fair, and transparent booking system that:

- Enforces the official 08:00 booking window and prevents early grabs
- Shows real-time availability and stops overlapping or double bookings
- Lets students book remotely with clear rules (slot lengths, limits, cancellations)
- Gives admins simple tools to manage rooms, set policies, and audit usage

Result: No more 8 AM rushes, fewer empty rooms, and more predictable practice time.

> ## What's about
>
> A flexible booking system powered by Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, designed to fit multiple use cases (music rooms, table-tennis courts, study rooms, etc.). It showcases a clean, scalable backend architecture with DTO-first endpoints, real-world validation (overlap checks, time-window rules), global exception handling, JWT authentication, and hashed passwords/tokens stored securelyâ€”following best practices for production-grade systems.

# ðŸš€ Features

## Auth Management

- Register
- Login
- Access and Refresh tokens

## User Management

- Fetch users
- Delete users
- Roles: USER, ADMIN
- Passwords safely hidden from API responses

## Room Management

- Create rooms
- Fetch Rooms
- Delete rooms
- Designed to be extendable (different room types, availability slots)

## Booking Management

- Create a booking
- Cancel a booking
- Fetch all bookings or by ID
- User get their own bookings detail
- Bookings keep status (CANCELLED) instead of being deleted

## DTO + Mapper Architecture

- Entities never exposed directly
- Request DTOs
- Response DTOs
- Mappers handle conversion between entities and DTOs
